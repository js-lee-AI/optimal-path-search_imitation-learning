# Imitation Learning; Optimal Multiple Path Search Using VAIL

## How to

**The Customized Grid-World environment and actions**

![environment actions](./img/girdworld-AE.PNG)<br>


***environment.py*** : Currently, the customized Grid-World of the 20x20 pixel window is configured.

***Expert dataset 1,2*** : Examples of configuring expert dataset with the pickle module

***expert_generator.py*** : You can use this file to create expert data.

***main.py*** : You can run this program by running ***main.py***.

## Result
### two obstacles - 10 x 10 GridWorld
You should need expert data to find approximately 50 shortest paths.
